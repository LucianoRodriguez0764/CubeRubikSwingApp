/////// Save/Load system ///////

When you save a state, a new file will be
created on the JAR path or directory path.
You can edit this .dat file to get some
cool states like... 

500000555577770000000000000000555577777777000000000000

This is useful for OLL practice, which 7 is an invalid color (0-5)
and so will return black.
